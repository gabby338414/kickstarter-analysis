### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered- the Challenges I faced were learning the different formulas in Excel, I have never used any of these functions, we have learned so far. The difficulties where moving back and forth between sheets using the formulas.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? There more successful outcomes.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? The percentage failed and successful were about the same.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? No really the outcomes were straight forward.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? A bar graphs and pie charts can also be used to determine certain data.
